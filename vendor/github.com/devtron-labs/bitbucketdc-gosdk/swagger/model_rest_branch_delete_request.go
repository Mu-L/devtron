The REST API is for developers who want to:    - integrate Bitbucket with other applications;   - create scripts that interact with Bitbucket; or   - develop plugins that enhance the Bitbucket UI, using REST to interact with the backend.    You can read more about developing Bitbucket plugins in the [Bitbucket Developer Documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/server/docs/latest/).
